## Description

This project is an implementation of my MSc study at University College London (UCL), which uses information of London bicycle sharing system (LBSS), and aims to develop a web tool that applies various spatio-temporal analytics and visualisation techniques. The main objective of the project is to uncover patterns, relationships and correlations that are observed in the cycling data.
